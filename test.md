Functional Tests

A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:
What should happen if the cart is empty?
What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!

1. test that user is able to check out as a guest without an account
2. test that a user is able to check out as a logged in user with an account
3. test that guest are asked to create account.
